## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r dice}
#The dice funtion, that randomly choses a number between 1 and 6, and where you let the program know how many dices are used.
one.dice <- function(){
  dice <- sample(1:6, size = 1, replace = TRUE)
  return(sum(dice))
}

#The windows of the plots
par(mfrow=c(1,1))

#The define of the colors
colors = c("red", "yellow", "green", "violet", "orange", "blue")

##The code section of the plotting
##The plot of the 1000x
#sims <- replicate(1000, one.dice())
#plot(table(sims),main = "Roll the dice 1000 times",xlab = 'Possible value', ylab = 'Frequency',col=colors)
#lines(table(sims), type='o')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
#The plot of the 1000x
sims <- replicate(1000, one.dice())
plot(table(sims),main = "Roll the dice 1000 times",xlab = 'Possible value', ylab = 'Frequency',col=colors)
lines(table(sims), type='o')
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
