## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
u=rnorm(100000,4000,700)

z=sample(u,100,replace=TRUE)
mean(z)

x=seq(mean(z)-3000, mean(z)+3000, by=0.1)
plot(x, dnorm(x,mean(z), 700),type="l")

abline(v=mean(u), col = "red")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
