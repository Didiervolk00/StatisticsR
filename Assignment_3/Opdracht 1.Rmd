## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
x = seq(0, 6000)
plot(dnorm(x, 3000, 500), type="l", xlab = "Aantal branduren", ylab = "Kans", main = "Kansdichtheidsfunctie van Type A", lwd=2)
qnorm(0.05, 3000, 500)

y = seq(0, 5000)
plot(dnorm(y, 2500, 100), type="l", xlab = "Aantal branduren", ylab = "Kans", main = "Kansdichtheidsfunctie van Type B", lwd=2)
qnorm(0.05, 2500, 100)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r , echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
